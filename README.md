# ft_printf (Hive Helsinki - 42)

What do you do when you are limited to what functions you can use? You make a libft.
Well what happens when one of those forbidden functions is one of the most popular like printf?
You make your own printf function.

At Hive, we donâ€™t have all the functions at our disposal. We have to complete projects with certain constraints.
Well things would be so much easier if we could just use printf.... but we can't. So in this project, we had to recreate the printf function.
We had to mirror the function as close as possible. This means handling the majority of the format specifiers and the flags.

As with all Hive projects, they come with restraints and limitations. We have to abide by the rules of `Norminette`. Here are some of the rules we must follow:

```
* Must be written in C
* 25 lines maximum per function
* 5 functions maximum per file
* 80 columns wide maximum
* 5 variables per function maximum
* For loops are forbidden
* Declaration and an initialisation cannot be on the same line
* A function can take 4 named parameters maximum
* Functions allowed:
  * write
  * malloc
  * free
  * exit
```

My printf function `ft_print` handles the the format specifiers `diouxXfspc%`, flags such as `+,-, ,0,*,#`, precision and width,
along with the modifiers `l, ll, h, hh, L`.
